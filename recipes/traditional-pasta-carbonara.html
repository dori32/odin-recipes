    <h2>Description</h2>  
    <p>Searching for an authentic Italian recipe for pasta alla carbonara? Here's the original way to cook carbonara, with tips and tricks from Fine Dining Lovers. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>320g spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>150 g guanciale</li>
        <li>50 g grated pecorino romano</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the carbonara, start by heating the pasta water. While waiting for the water to boil, prepare the guanciale. Remove any rind and slice into strips, about 1 cm thick. Our tip: use less, rather than more water for the pasta. Cooking the pasta in less water will give you creamier results as the starch will be concentrated in less liquid.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan. When hot, add the guanciale strips.            </li>
            <li>Cook the guanciale until it becomes crunchy, then remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a sheet of absorbent paper. Spread the guanciale out well, which should help keep its crunchiness.</li>
            <li>Leave the guanciale's cooking fat in the pan, it's vital for dressing the carbonara later to add flavour to the pasta.</li>
            <li>When the pasta water boils, add salt and then the spaghetti.            </li>
            <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, break the eggs and place the yolks in a very large glass bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg yolks and add the pepper and grated pecorino. Mix well with a whisk until you get a firm mixture.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta al dente, keeping back a glass of its cooking water. Toss the spaghetti quickly in the guanciale's remaining cooking fat.</li>
            <li>Add a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water to the egg mixture and dilute it to obtain a thick and enveloping cream.</li>
            <li>At this point, put the spaghetti in a bowl. Add the egg mixture and mix quickly to amalgamate all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the crispy guanciale, stir one last time and serve your original spaghetti carbonara immediately.</li>
        </ol>
